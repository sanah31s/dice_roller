**Project Overview:**

The Dice Roller project is a web application designed to simulate rolling dice. It provides users with an interactive platform where they can specify the number of dice they want to roll and view both the numerical results and corresponding dice images. This project aims to offer a fun and engaging experience for users interested in games or simulations involving dice.

**Problem and Solution Statement:**

The problem addressed by this project is the need for a simple yet effective way to simulate rolling dice in a web environment. While rolling dice is a fundamental aspect of many games and activities, it can be cumbersome to do so manually, especially in digital settings. The Dice Roller project provides a solution by offering a user-friendly web application where users can roll virtual dice with ease and view the results instantly.

**Implementation**

*_HTML (index.html):_*

The HTML file provides the structure for the web page.
It includes input fields for the number of dice and a button to trigger the dice roll.
There are also placeholder elements to display the result of the dice roll (numeric values) and the corresponding images of the rolled dice.

*_CSS (style.css):_*

The CSS file styles the HTML elements to enhance the visual appeal of the web page.
It defines the appearance of the container, buttons, input fields, and the dice result.
Additionally, it specifies the styling for dice images displayed after rolling.

_*JavaScript (index.js):*_

The JavaScript file contains the logic for rolling dice and updating the web page accordingly.
When the "Roll Dice!" button is clicked, the rollDice() function is called.
Inside this function, it retrieves the number of dice specified by the user and generates random values for each die.
It then creates HTML elements to display both the numeric result and the corresponding dice images.
Finally, it updates the respective elements in the HTML to show the results.

**Implementation Strategy:**

The implementation of the Dice Roller project involves the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the necessary user interface and functionality. HTML is used to structure the web page, CSS is employed for styling and visual appeal, and JavaScript handles the logic for rolling dice and updating the display based on user input. The project follows a modular approach, with separate files for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure clean and organized code.

**Usage:**

Users can interact with the Dice Roller project by visiting the web page and following these steps:

1. Input the desired number of dice they want to roll using the provided input field.
2. Click the "Roll Dice!" button to initiate the dice roll.
3. The application will generate random values for each die and display both the numerical results and corresponding dice images.
4. Users can repeat the process by adjusting the number of dice and clicking the button again for subsequent rolls.

**Features:**

- User-friendly interface for specifying the number of dice to roll.
- Instantaneous display of both numerical results and corresponding dice images.
- Dynamic updating of results based on user input.
- Visually appealing design with customizable CSS styles.
